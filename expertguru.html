          <h2> The process: User centered design</h2>
          <p>
            The design process was in the spotlight of creating ExpertGuru. The primary challenge was to satisfy a whole set of requirements, solve users' problems and create unique experiences. It was especially important that users feel relaxed
            using
            the app and afterward feel confident and at ease. Product should be perceived on the market as unique and friendly.

          <h2> My role</h2>
          <p>
            Responsible for UX and delivering design assets.
            My work started with conducting market, competitor and user research. Synthesis revealed a surprisingly big market and potential for such a product. After task analysis, concepts were crafted, including navigation and flows study. It was
            really interesting to see how prototypes improved from the initial concepts to the final product thanks to user testing and design collaboration.

          <p>
            ''Style is a way to say who you are without having to speak.'' R. Zoe
            People sometimes feel overwhelmed by all styling choices they need to make. With so many possibilities it is really time consuming and there are no personalised guidelines. When you wear something that makes you feel great, the effects
            may
            be subtle, but they matter. ExpertGuru's users need to get quick and reliable advice from style experts in order to have appropriate personalised appearance for every event and to be able to perform at their very best. In order to easier
            perceive themselves in a perfect outfit, there is also an inspirational area that gives supporting evidence for their styling ideas.

          <h2> Approaching design through research</h2>
          <p>
            Design process started with gathering and analysis of a vast amount of information. It was important to understand market, competitors and users.

            <h3>Competitor analysis</h3>
            <p>
              ExpertGuru considered other industry leads. Approaches and solutions of direct and indirect competition were analysed and the best practices and trends were highlighted (in terms of marketing strategy, target users, usability, layout,
              navigation structure, responsibility, content, design and performance). Together with SWOT analysis it helped to assess current offers in this area.

              <h4>Online Survey</h4>
              <p>
                The survey asked respondents questions about their approach to styling and experience with styling experts.

              <h5>Learnings</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>33% of the participants were thinking about working with a stylist and about 25% has actually done it. Participants were moderately satisfied with the results.</li>
                <li>Most participants would use the app to consult a stylist. 50% would do it for some special occasion and about 30% daily or for overall outfit tips. </li>

              <h4>Interviews and field studies</h4>
              <p>
                With insights from the survey, I visited and interviewed people about styling. I wanted to observe what is important for them while they are choosing outfits, how their mood is changing, how they are making decisions and what would
                help
                them to make easier choices and feel better afterwards. I took notes about my observations and at the end of the session asked questions. Some of the questions were:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Have you ever asked a stylist, friend or anyone to help you with choosing an outfit? How were you feeling?</li>
                <li>What is important for you when you choose an outfit? </li>
                <li>What information would you like to know about stylist before booking one? </li>
                <li>Would you consider having overall styling or for specific events? Why? How often?</li>
                <li>Would you share your outfit afterwards with other users? Would you write a review to a stylist?</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Learnings</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>``When choosing the stylist I would look at reviews, price and their portfolio. I would like to see what is a good outfit for her/him and compare it with my taste.``</li>
                <li>``I would not post my pictures, but I would write the review about the stylist with all the steps we did to inform others about the experience.``</li>
                <li>``When I am going somewhere with my girlfriends, we ask each other for opinions. If I go to some important event I also ask my father or brother what they think about my outfit. I believe in their opinion about girls’ outfits. I
                  always ask for opinion if am 66% happy with my outfit to get those last 33% of self-confidence boost that I am missing.``</li>
                <li>``I would definitely start with a special event. If I were happy with a stylist, I would also book her/him for overall styling. I think that sessions for overall styling should be once a month for 1 hour. I can try some new
                  combinations, and show her/him what I have bought and then we can also develop together some outfits.``</li>
                <li>``I would definitely like to see what my stylist wears on busy days when he/she has a lot of things to do. I assume he/she would wear something comfortable ...and I would compare it with my style. Then I would see if he/she passes
                  my personal criteria.``</li>

              <h4>Affinity map</h4>
              <p>
                I used an affinity map to group similar observations together. Afterwards they were organised into clusters with similar patterns and themes.
              </p>
              <h5>Learnings</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>People love to dress well in order to feel good about themselves</li>
                <li>Looking at others and searching through apps or web pages gives inspiration while dressing </li>
                <li>Comparing experts gives possibility to choose best quality/price choice </li>
                <li>Experts should have specialisations</li>
                <li>People would post reviews in order to give feedback/help other users with choosing a stylist</li>
                <li>Calendar is important in order to see free appointments or get an immediate session</li>
                <li>Trust between customer and expert is really important</li>
                <li>Video Call is a feature that can be used independently of location</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Synthesis</h3>
              <p>
                Information about experts should be visible, well organised, filterable and comparable. Some of the significant information that makes stylists comparable are: availability, specialisation, portfolio, reviews and price.
                Communication between users and experts goes via chat or video call. Posting a review should be possible after the session in order to improve credibility of the stylist.
                Section “Inspirational outfits” is useful to make style statements more clear and decrease the chances that an idea may be wrongly applied.

            <h3>User persona of a typical ExpertGuru user</h3>
            <p>
              I created a user persona to put a face on ExpertGuru’s target user and visualise various aspects of their behaviour and motivations. This persona was based on the survey, interviews and observations during the user research.
              We can divide ExpertGuru`s users into two main groups. People who love fashion and need advices for daily outfits because they want to feel more confident (Nicole). Second group are people who don’t want to have an everyday style but
              would like to look good on special occasions. For them it is important that the service is simple, quick and cheap (Tiago).

            <h3>Mental models and user journeys</h3>
            <p>
              With insight and data collected during user research, I have created corresponding mental models and user journeys. They provided me with deeper understanding of user motivations and thought processes, along with the emotional context
              in
              which they’re using your product.
              In order to visualise the individual steps that a user needs to make in order to reach their goal, I have created user flows. They are straightforward, since some unnecessary and unfavourable steps were coming to light and therefore
              rejected.

            <h3>Information architecture</h3>
            <p>
              Structures describe how information is connected within the application and shown in hierarchy illustrated in the sitemap. Co-Existing hierarchy was the best choice for ExpertGuru app because a lot of information is overlapping. Each
              area
              of application has equal importance and users can use different features within the app.
              Based on the information gained from the initial content audits, competitor analysis and user research I have built the basic sitemap. I have tested the sitemap with Card Sorting in order to organise IA in a more logical and meaningful
              way. After getting results, I have learned that some categories are logical but also that some changes need to be made. The newly designed IA increases the visibility of the app’s key features and improves the overall organisation and
              navigation throughout the app.

            <h3>Low-fidelity prototypes</h3>
            <p>
              Low-fidelity prototypes were done with paper and pencil since it is a fast medium and changes can be made easily. Although software makes our work more productive, sketching is a first step in the design process and wireframes can be
              thought through while exploring an idea.

            <p>
              High-fidelity prototypes were used for testing. They have refined details, show how real UI elements might look like and include much better functionality. Since they provide the closest representation of an idea, they were used to
              effectively communicate functionality, UI and overall product experience.

              Usability tests were done with high-fidelity prototypes to which I added colors. They gave me interesting feedback and thanks to my testers constructive comments, conversations emerged about different features. I had the opportunity to
              dive into different points of view and learn a lot.

            <p>
              Six moderated usability tests were carried out for the first mobile iteration of the ExpertGuru app.
              Overall, the prototype received good feedback with a note that some unnecessary frictions in the app should be reviewed for the future use. The most criticised part was the homepage and search option.
              With audio and video recordings of usability tests, I created affinity maps pointing out observations, errors, positive and negative quotes. The most important findings have been collected in the Rainbow Spreadsheet. The main errors
              were
              rated using the Jakob Nielsen scale of error severity (0-5).

            <h3>Design Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              Doing a project is like raising a baby. We watch it develop, try and fail; and at the end it is a beautiful piece ready to make impact on its own. Although it is UX Designers job to finish this task, we also must admit that more eyes
              looking at the project can catch mistakes and make important and iterative refinements. Collaboration is really important and in larger teams, multiple designers work on the same project in order to be able to meet project deadlines.
              Before finishing the project, ExpertGuru had the opportunity to be reviewed by 4 of my peers. The reviews were positive, but they also had some suggestions that were applied.

          <h2>Deliver: Tell the difference</h2>
          <p>
            A design language system makes it possible to ensure that a single brand has a cohesive user experience across platforms. Each design language system consists of one or more design languages that help maintain consistency in design on a
            single platform. When creating design language system it was important to apply Gestalt Principles and respect the 8-column grid. The main elements are color, typography, iconography, common UI components, grid/layout, interactions, tone
            of
            voice and accessibility.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility </h2>
            <p>ExpertGuru is a great friend of its users who doesn’t judge and make differences between them. Therefore, it is really important that it is seen as a product accessible to everyone in any situation.
              It is a critical property of visual design, but it is often ignored. All the mockups were checked for compliance with WCAG 2.0. I used the Color Contrast Analyzer application for the verification. It provided the necessary metrics and
              allowed to check the color and contrast ratio in relation to various eyesight defects.
              With user interface ExpertGuru prioritises:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Low-Vision Users: Although minimalisticaly designed, the app is offering high-contrast screens. Also, the app is really intuitive to use, and readability is accentuated by visual clarity of the content.</li>
              <li>Color-Blind Users: App is designed with high contrast and hierarchy of design patterns is clear. Also, color themes are accessible and applicable to the whole user interface.</li>
              <li>Blind Users: Audio-only interfaces are available through AI readers and assistants. </li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Learn: Make progress while designing</h2>
          <p>
            This was a really interesting project to work on because it makes an impact on users that struggle with something I love.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Addressing right problems: When people struggle with some decision, it is important that the user flow is simple. They are overwhelmed anyway and the product should be as intuitive as possible.</li>
            <li>Don't wait until the end to make small changes: Updating design deliverables constantly is important. During the design process changes are made but they should be adopted to all design deliverables accordingly. Some details may be
              changed that don't work on all screens.</li>
            <li>All feedback matter: Designing alone may be challenging. It is important to have a peer group with whom you can discuss challenges. Also, feedback about design choices from non-designers can be equally helpful. It is always useful to
              consider different perspectives. </li>
            <li>Go with the flow: While designing situations may occur, where we find ourselves tangled between all the information we need to consider. The best way to declutter is just to start working on a piece we understand. Step by step the
              dots
              will get connected and the idea is going to be shaped.</li>
